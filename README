Lidar based docking for ROS1 (in progress)
===============================

This package provides ros1 services to perform basic Lidar Autodock using ICP and RANSAC. Combining the two algorithms can be beneficial. Here's how:
-    RANSAC is used to find the initial translation and rotation of the dock relative to the robot's frame. RANSAC is suitable for this task because it's robust to outliers.
-    Then, ICP is used to fine-tune the pose (especially the orientation) of the dock. ICP is suitable for fine-grained alignment when you have a good initial estimate.


Requirements:
```bash
# step 0: install ubuntu 20 and the ros noetic distro
# $ sudo apt install -y blah blah blah

```


Services:
```bash
[1] /v_dock/save_dock - "/v_dock/save_dock".
[2] /v_dock/dock_service - "/v_dock/dock_service".
[3] /v_dock/undock_service - "/v_dock/undock_service".
[]4 /v_dock/dock_notification - "returns: done, reverse in-progress, forward in-progress, stopping, breakdown/fault etc.".
```
